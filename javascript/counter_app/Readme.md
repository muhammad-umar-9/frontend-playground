- **Save Entries**: Save current count to history
- **Reset**: Clear counter and history
- **History**: View last 5 saved entries

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

## Learning Journey

This is my **first JavaScript project** as I'm learning JavaScript through a project-based approach. While building this counter app, I learned and implemented the following JavaScript concepts:

### JavaScript Concepts Learned:
- **Script Tag**: How to include JavaScript in HTML using `<script>` tags
- **Variables**: Declaring and using variables with `let` to store data
- **Numbers**: Working with numeric values and mathematical operations
- **Strings**: Handling text data and string manipulation
- **Console.log**: Using the browser console for debugging and output
- **Functions**: Creating reusable code blocks to perform specific tasks
- **The DOM**: Understanding the Document Object Model and how to interact with HTML elements
- **getElementById**: Selecting specific HTML elements by their ID
- **innerText & textContent**: Manipulating the content of HTML elements dynamically

### Key Functions Created:
- `increment()` - Adds 1 to the counter
- `decrement()` - Subtracts 1 from the counter
- `save()` - Saves current count to history
- `reset()` - Resets counter and clears history

This project helped me understand how JavaScript brings interactivity to web pages and how the three core web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) work together.
